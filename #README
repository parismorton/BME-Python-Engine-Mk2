#README

I made this python engine for the robotic hand. Feel free to use it.

In order to run this, download all the files and put them into one folder on your Desktop. 
Change your Terminal directory to the newly-created folder. cd ~ then cd Desktop then cd yourfolder
Type "python central.py" to start the engine.

Usage/Overview:
The python script works by reading the individual letters you type in, and then running the assigned script to the letters.
For example, if you type "hello", it will run the script assigned to H, then the script assigned E, then the script to L, then the script to L again, then finally the script to O.
The scripts for the individual letter CAN BE CHANGED to do anything. The goal is to make the scripts move servos.
Example: You type in hello. The script will move the servos according to what you've commanded in H file. Then the E, etc.



I know the way I wrote this was all very confusing so pls feel free to ask questions.
